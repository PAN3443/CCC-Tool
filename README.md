# CCC-Tool

The CCC-Tool is an open source project based on the idea of a general tool for the creation and export of colormaps with the effort to minimize the needed interaction components. To make this possible, we developed a colormap specification CMS, which descripe colormaps with a minimum number of key-colors. This foundation of the tool is extended by a collection of recommended colormaps (Gallery-Section), which can be adapted to encode the users own domain-specific semantics, and the facilities for analyzing colormaps. CCC-Tool supports some commonly-used color spaces and color difference metrics, currently including RGB, HSV, CIELAB, CIE94, CIEDE2000, and DIN99.
